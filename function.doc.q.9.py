# Q9.Write a Python program to generate and print a list of first and last 5 elements where
# the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included).
# Output :-([1, 4, 9, 16, 25], [676, 729, 784, 841, 900]).

# def squre():
#     i=0
#     c=[]
#     d=[]
#     while i<=30:
#         if i>=1 and i<=5:
#             c.append(i*i)
#         elif i>=26 and i<=30:
#             d.append(i*i)
#         i+=1
#     print(c,",",d) 
# squre()
