#  Write a function named add_numbers_list which takes 2 lists of two integers and then prints the sum of the integers with the same position.

# # Use the add_numbers function given in Part 1 to count 2 integers that have the same position.

# If we give [50, 60, 10] and [10, 20, 13] to this function it will print this
# 60
# 80
# 23

# def add_numbers_function ():
#     a=[50, 60, 10]
#     b=[10, 20, 13]
#     i=0
#     while i<len(a):
#         print(a[i]+b[i])
#         i=i+1
# add_numbers_function()
